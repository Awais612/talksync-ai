# TalkSync AI

TalkSync AI is a **real-time messaging platform** inspired by **WhatsApp Web**, built to demonstrate modern **full-stack engineering**, **scalable architecture**, and practical **AI-powered features**.  

The application enables seamless one-to-one and group communication with **Socket.IO** for real-time interactions, a structured **Nest.js backend**, and a responsive **Next.js frontend**. Data persistence and relational modeling are handled using **PostgreSQL + Prisma ORM**, with optional **Redis** integration for WebSocket scaling and caching.

Unlike traditional chat apps, TalkSync AI introduces **lightweight artificial intelligence features** to enhance the user experience:  

- ü§ñ **Smart Reply Suggestions** ‚Äì AI generates quick, context-aware responses for incoming messages, enabling instant replies.  
- üìå **Chat Summaries** ‚Äì Long conversations are distilled into concise overviews so users can catch up quickly.  
- üñºÔ∏è **AI Media Captions** ‚Äì Images receive auto-generated captions, adding accessibility and context.
